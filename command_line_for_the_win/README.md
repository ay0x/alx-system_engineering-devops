Upload using SFTP in the terminal with the following steps below.

- Connect to SFT using: "sftp remote_username@server_ip_or_hostname".

- Enter your sftp password in the next prompt.

- Navigate to the directory you want to copy to the server using 'lcd /dir'. Note: The 'l' in the 'lcd' means you want to change the local directory not the server directory.

- Upload all the files from the local directory using 'put *' into the currect directory of the server.
